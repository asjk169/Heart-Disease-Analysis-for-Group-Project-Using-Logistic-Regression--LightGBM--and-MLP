# Application of Logistic Regression, LightGBM, and MLP over Cross-Sectional Dataset (Heart Disease) for Group Project.

This is a minimal and self-study implementation of Logistic Regression using Scikit-learn, Gradient Boosting Tree using LightGBM, and simple MLP using PyTorch.

It includes train/validation/test datasets splits, feature engineering, data preprocess, Optuna hyperparameter tuning, permutation feature importance analysis.

Dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease
